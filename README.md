RON is a simple readable data serialization format that looks similar to Rust syntax.
It's designed to support all of [Serde's data model](https://serde.rs/data-model.html), so
structs, enums, tuples, arrays, generic maps, and primitive values.

## Example

```rust,ignore
GameConfig( // optional struct name
    window_size: (800, 600),
    window_title: "PAC-MAN",
    fullscreen: false,

    mouse_sensitivity: 1.4,
    key_bindings: {
        "up": Up,
        "down": Down,
        "left": Left,
        "right": Right,

        // Uncomment to enable WASD controls
        /*
        "W": Up,
        "S": Down,
        "A": Left,
        "D": Right,
        */
    },

    difficulty_options: (
        start_difficulty: Easy,
        adaptive: false,
    ),
)
```

## RON syntax overview

* Numbers: `42`, `3.14`, `0xFF`, `0b0110`
* Strings: `"Hello"`, `"with\\escapes\n"`, `r#"raw string, great for regex\."#`
* Byte Strings: `b"Hello"`, `b"with \x65\x73\x63\x61\x70\x65\x73\n"`, `br#"raw, too"#`
* Booleans: `true`, `false`
* Chars: `'e'`, `'\n'`
* Optionals: `Some("string")`, `Some(Some(1.34))`, `None`
* Tuples: `("abc", 1.23, true)`, `()`
* Lists: `["abc", "def"]`
* Structs: `( foo: 1.0, bar: ( baz: "I'm nested" ) )`
* Maps: `{ "arbitrary": "keys", "are": "allowed" }`

> **Note:** Serde's data model represents fixed-size Rust arrays as tuple (instead of as list)

RON also supports several extensions, which are documented [here](docs/extensions.md).

## Specification

RON's formal and complete grammar is available [here](docs/grammar.md).

There also is a very basic, work in progress specification available on
[the wiki page](https://github.com/ron-rs/ron/wiki/Specification).

## Why RON?

### Example in JSON

```json
{
   "materials": {
        "metal": {
            "reflectivity": 1.0
        },
        "plastic": {
            "reflectivity": 0.5
        }
   },
   "entities": [
        {
            "name": "hero",
            "material": "metal"
        },
        {
            "name": "monster",
            "material": "plastic"
        }
   ]
}
```

### Same example in RON

```rust,ignore
Scene( // class name is optional
    materials: { // this is a map
        "metal": (
            reflectivity: 1.0,
        ),
        "plastic": (
            reflectivity: 0.5,
        ),
    },
    entities: [ // this is an array
        (
            name: "hero",
            material: "metal",
        ),
        (
            name: "monster",
            material: "plastic",
        ),
    ],
)
```

Note the following advantages of RON over JSON:

* trailing commas allowed
* single- and multi-line comments
* field names aren't quoted, so it's less verbose
* optional struct names improve readability
* enums are supported (and less verbose than their JSON representation)

## Quickstart

### `Cargo.toml`

```toml
[dependencies]
ron = "0.8"
serde = { version = "1", features = ["derive"] }
```

### `main.rs`

```rust
use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};

#[derive(Debug, Deserialize, Serialize)]
struct MyStruct {
    boolean: bool,
    float: f32,
}

fn main() {
    let x: MyStruct = ron::from_str("(boolean: true, float: 1.23)").unwrap();

    println!("RON: {}", ron::to_string(&x).unwrap());

    println!("Pretty RON: {}", ron::ser::to_string_pretty(
        &x, ron::ser::PrettyConfig::default()).unwrap(),
    );
}
```

## Limitations

RON is not designed to be a fully self-describing format (unlike JSON) and is thus not guaranteed to work when [`deserialize_any`](https://docs.rs/serde/latest/serde/trait.Deserializer.html#tymethod.deserialize_any) is used instead of its typed alternatives. In particular, the following Serde attributes only have limited support:

- `#[serde(tag = "tag")]`, i.e. internally tagged enums [^serde-enum-hack]
- `#[serde(tag = "tag", content = "content")]`, i.e. adjacently tagged enums [^serde-enum-hack]
- `#[serde(untagged)]`, i.e. untagged enums [^serde-enum-hack]
- `#[serde(flatten)]`, i.e. flattening of structs into maps [^serde-flatten-hack]

While data structures with any of these attributes should generally roundtrip through RON, some restrictions apply [^serde-restrictions] and their textual representation may not always match your expectation:

- ron only supports string keys inside maps flattened into structs
- internally (or adjacently) tagged or untagged enum variants or `#[serde(flatten)]`ed fields must not contain:
  - struct names, e.g. by enabling the `PrettyConfig::struct_names` setting
  - newtypes
  - zero-length arrays / tuples / tuple structs / structs / tuple variants / struct variants
    - `Option`s with `#[enable(implicit_some)]` must not contain any of these or a unit, unit struct, or an untagged unit variant
  - externally tagged tuple variants with just one field (that are not newtype variants)
  - tuples or arrays with just one element are not supported inside newtype variants with `#[enable(unwrap_variant_newtypes)]`
  - a `ron::value::RawValue`
- internally tagged newtype variants and `#[serde(flatten)]`ed fields must not contain:
  - a unit or a unit struct inside an untagged newtype variant
  - an untagged unit variant
- untagged tuple / struct variants with no fields are not supported
- untagged tuple variants with just one field (that are not newtype variants) are not supported when the `#![enable(unwrap_variant_newtypes)]` extension is enabled
- serializing a `ron::value::RawValue` using a `PrettyConfig` may add leading and trailing whitespace and comments, which the `ron::value::RawValue` absorbs upon deserialization

Furthermore, serde imposes the following restrictions for data to roundtrip:

- structs or struct variants that contain a `#[serde(flatten)]`ed field:
  - are only serialised as maps and deserialised from maps
  - must not contain duplicate fields / keys, e.g. where an inner-struct field matches an outer-struct or inner-struct field
  - must not contain more than one (within the super-struct of all flattened structs) `#[serde(flatten)]`ed map field, which collects all unknown fields
  - if they contain a `#[serde(flatten)]`ed map, they must not contain:
    - a struct that is not flattened itself but contains some flattened fields and is flattened into the outer struct (variant)
    - an untagged struct variant that contains some flattened fields
    - a flattened externally tagged newtype, tuple, or struct variant, flattened internally tagged unit, newtype, or struct variant, or any flattened adjacently tagged variant
    - a flattened tagged struct
- internally (or adjacently) tagged or untagged enum variants or `#[serde(flatten)]`ed fields must not contain:
  - `i128` or `u128` values

Please file a [new issue](https://github.com/ron-rs/ron/issues/new) if you come across a use case which is not listed among the above restrictions but still breaks.

While RON guarantees roundtrips like Rust -> RON -> Rust for Rust types using non-`deserialize_any`-based implementations, RON does not yet make any guarantees about roundtrips through `ron::Value`. For instance, even when RON -> Rust works, RON -> `ron::Value` -> Rust, or RON -> `ron::Value` -> RON -> Rust may not work. We plan on improving `ron::Value` in an upcoming version of RON, though this work is partially blocked on [serde#1183](https://github.com/serde-rs/serde/issues/1183).

[^serde-enum-hack]: Deserialising an internally, adjacently, or un-tagged enum requires detecting `serde`'s internal `serde::__private::de::content::Content` content type so that RON can describe the deserialised data structure in serde's internal JSON-like format. This detection only works for the automatically-derived [`Deserialize`](https://docs.rs/serde/latest/serde/de/trait.Deserialize.html) impls on enums. See [#451](https://github.com/ron-rs/ron/pull/451) for more details.

[^serde-flatten-hack]: Deserialising a flattened struct from a map requires that the struct's [`Visitor::expecting`](https://docs.rs/serde/latest/serde/de/trait.Visitor.html#tymethod.expecting) implementation formats a string starting with `"struct "`. This is the case for automatically-derived [`Deserialize`](https://docs.rs/serde/latest/serde/de/trait.Deserialize.html) impls on structs. See [#455](https://github.com/ron-rs/ron/pull/455) for more details.

[^serde-restrictions]: Most of these restrictions are currently blocked on [serde#1183](https://github.com/serde-rs/serde/issues/1183), which limits non-self-describing formats from roundtripping format-specific information through internally (or adjacently) tagged or untagged enums or `#[serde(flatten)]`ed fields.
